# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aravind Kumar

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the University of Bath, currently in my second year, with a passion for full stack development, data analysis, and machine learning. Through my various projects and internship experience, I am constantly driven by my curiosity for learning new technologies and solving complex problems.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- **Sentimatic**: A platform designed to revolutionise the way users interpret customer feedback from e-commerce products. By scraping reviews and leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), Sentimatic will offer actionable insights and sentiment trends, enabling users to make well-informed purchasing decisions with ease. My vision is to provide a medium for exciting data-driven insights from e-commerce reviews, all presented in an intuitive and engaging format.
